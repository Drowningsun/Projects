The system checks the doctorâ€™s availability and confirms the booking.
Checking an Appointment
The user enters their PIN to check their scheduled appointments.
Scheduling a Follow-up
The user enters their PIN and selects the doctor for a follow-up.
The system provides available dates for scheduling.
