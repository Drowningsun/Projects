    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h3>Brief Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This mini-project is designed to help users book appointments with doctors efficiently. 
        The system allows users to create a file containing their basic details, such as 
        <strong>name, address, and age</strong>. Each patient file is accessed using a unique 
        <strong>Patient Identity Number (PIN)</strong>. Users can:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Book an appointment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Check their appointment status</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Schedule a follow-up with their previous doctor</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The project aims to implement a system for <strong>patients to book appointments</strong>, 
        <strong>manage scheduling</strong>, and <strong>check doctor availability</strong> efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>
        This system is designed to <strong>streamline</strong> the appointment booking process in a hospital setting. 
        It provides a <strong>user-friendly interface</strong> for both <strong>patients</strong> and 
        <strong>hospital staff</strong> to manage appointments efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>System Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Hardware Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i3 or higher</li>
        <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB or higher</li>
        <li><strong>Hard Disk:</strong> 100MB of free space</li>
        <li><strong>Display:</strong> 800x600 resolution or higher</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Software Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Windows, macOS, or Linux</li>
        <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)</li>
        <li><strong>Text Editor:</strong> Any code editor such as VS Code or Notepad++</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design and Development</h2>

    <h3>Program Logic</h3>
    <p>
        The program consists of the <strong>main function</strong> and <strong>five user-defined functions</strong>. 
        The main function provides choices for the following tasks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Book an appointment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Check an existing appointment</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Schedule a follow-up appointment</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Booking an Appointment</h3>
    <p>
        - The system checks if the patient has an existing record in the hospital. <br>
        - If <strong>yes</strong>, the user enters their <strong>PIN</strong> to access their file. <br>
        - If <strong>no</strong>, a new file is created by entering <strong>name, age, and address</strong>. <br>
        - The system provides a list of <strong>available doctors</strong>, allowing the user to select a doctor and enter a preferred date. <br>
        - The system checks the doctorâ€™s availability and confirms the booking.
    </p>

    <h3>Checking an Appointment</h3>
    <p>The user enters their <strong>PIN</strong> to check their scheduled appointments.</p>

    <h3>Scheduling a Follow-up</h3>
    <p>
        - The user enters their <strong>PIN</strong> and selects the doctor for a follow-up. <br>
        - The system provides available dates for scheduling.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This Hospital Appointment Management System enables users to 
        <strong>easily book, check, and manage medical appointments</strong> through a user-friendly interface, 
        reducing the need for phone calls or in-person visits. The system provides 
        <strong>real-time doctor availability</strong> and allows patients to select convenient appointment times.
    </p>

    <p>
        By improving <strong>efficiency and accessibility</strong>, this system enhances <strong>patient satisfaction</strong> 
        and contributes to <strong>better healthcare outcomes</strong>.
